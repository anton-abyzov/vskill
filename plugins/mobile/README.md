## Installation

The plugin is automatically installed with vskill. To verify installation:

```bash
# List installed plugins
claude plugin list --installed | grep sw-mobile
```

To reinstall or update:

```bash
# Reinstall plugin
vskill add --repo anton-abyzov/vskill --plugin mobile
```

## Usage

### Skills Auto-Activate

Skills automatically activate based on conversation keywords:

```
You: "How do I set up Xcode for React Native development?"
→ react-native-setup skill activates

You: "How do I optimize FlatList performance?"
→ performance-optimization skill activates

You: "I need to debug network requests in my app"
→ mobile-debugging skill activates
```

### Invoke the React Native Expert Skill

For architectural decisions, system design, setup, and debugging:

```
Use the Skill tool to invoke the react-native-expert skill:

Skill({
  skill: "sw-mobile:react-native-expert",
  args: "Design a scalable React Native architecture for a social media app with feed, messaging, and profile features. Include state management, navigation, and performance considerations."
})
```

- Provides code examples

### 3. Debugging Network Issues

**User asks**: "API calls are failing on Android but working on iOS"

**What happens**:
- `mobile-debugging` skill activates
- Guides through network debugging
- Checks localhost vs 10.0.2.2 configuration
- Sets up Flipper network inspector

### 4. Architecture Design

**User invokes**: react-native-expert skill

**What happens**:
- Skill analyzes requirements
- Recommends folder structure
- Selects state management solution
- Designs navigation architecture
- Provides implementation templates

## Integration with vskill Workflows

### During Increment Planning

When using `/sw:increment` for mobile features:

1. **Spec Creation** - Mobile architect reviews requirements
2. **Architecture Design** - Agent recommends patterns and structure
3. **Task Generation** - Includes setup, development, testing, and optimization tasks
4. **Test Planning** - Embeds test cases in tasks.md (BDD format)

### During Implementation

When using `/sw:do`:

1. **Environment Setup** - react-native-setup skill guides configuration
2. **Development** - Skills activate based on task context

## Examples

### Example 1: Setup iOS Simulator

```
You: "I installed Xcode but can't run the iOS simulator"

Claude (with react-native-setup skill):
Let me help you troubleshoot iOS simulator setup.

First, let's verify Xcode command line tools:
```bash
xcode-select --install
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

Check available simulators:
```bash
xcrun simctl list devices
```

[Provides detailed troubleshooting steps...]
```

### Example 2: Optimize Performance

```
You: "My feed is rendering slowly with 1000 items"

Claude (with performance-optimization skill):
I see you're rendering a long list. Here are optimizations:

1. Use FlashList instead of FlatList (60% faster):
```javascript
import { FlashList } from "@shopify/flash-list";

<FlashList
  data={items}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <ItemCard item={item} />}
  estimatedItemSize={80}
/>
```

2. Implement getItemLayout for fixed heights:
[Provides implementation...]

3. Use React.memo for ItemCard:
[Provides code example...]
```

### Example 3: Architecture Design

```
User invokes: react-native-expert skill

"Design architecture for a social media app with posts, comments, and real-time chat"

Skill response:
# Architecture Recommendation: Social Media App

## Folder Structure (Feature-Based)
```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── feed/
│   ├── chat/
│   └── profile/
├── shared/
└── navigation/
```

## State Management
Recommendation: Redux Toolkit + React Query
- Redux: Global state (auth, user profile)
- React Query: Server state (feed, posts, comments)

## Navigation
React Navigation with:
- Stack Navigator (root)
- Tab Navigator (main)
- Chat Navigator (nested)

[Provides complete architecture with code examples...]
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Fast Device Testing**: Use development builds with EAS for custom native code
2. **Performance**: Enable Hermes V1 (experimental) for faster startup and smaller bundles
3. **Debugging**: Use the new React DevTools Desktop App (RN 0.83)
4. **Testing**: Start with React Native Testing Library, add Detox for critical paths
5. **Optimization**: Use Web Performance APIs (performance.now, User Timing) for profiling
6. **iOS**: Target iOS 26+ for Liquid Glass effects
7. **Android**: Use API 35 with edge-to-edge for modern UI

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Activating?

1. Use relevant keywords from the activation list above
2. Be specific about the problem (e.g., "iOS simulator not working" vs "help with mobile")
3. Restart Claude Code if recently installed plugin
