# Code Simplifier

## Approach

Refine code for clarity and maintainability without changing behavior:

1. **Simplify** — Reduce complexity, extract clarity from dense logic
2. **Consistency** — Align naming, patterns, and structure
3. **Readability** — Improve variable names, reduce nesting, clarify intent
4. **Dead code** — Remove unused imports, variables, unreachable branches

Rules: Never change WHAT code does, only HOW it reads. All tests must stay green.
