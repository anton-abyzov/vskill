# Security Review

## Security Assessment

Perform security assessment:

1. **OWASP Top 10** — Check for injection, XSS, CSRF, broken auth, etc.
2. **Threat modeling** — Identify attack surfaces and data flow risks
3. **Auth review** — Authentication and authorization design
4. **Dependency audit** — Check for known CVEs

For real-time pattern detection during coding, use `/security:security-patterns` instead.
